# Offensive AI in the cyber kill chain

## Overview of the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC)
AI can be embedded into this process to enhance automation, scale, and sophistication.

| Kill Chain Stage      | AI-Augmented Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reconnaissance**     | Using AI to gather, process, and prioritize OSINT data (e.g., employee emails, domains) |
| **Weaponization**      | Automatically generating tailored payloads, shellcode, or phishing kits via LLMs        |
| **Delivery**           | AI-crafted emails, deepfakes, QR phishing, or automated template generation             |
| **Exploitation**       | Scripted attacks informed by LLM suggestions, fuzzing, or prompt-driven chaining        |
| **Installation**       | Polymorphic malware generation, using mutation or AI-driven obfuscation                 |
| **C2 (Command & Control)** | Natural language C2 agents, GPT-based shell interpreters, and low-detection communication |
| **Actions on Objectives** | Post-exploitation automation: file triage, data exfiltration scripting, privilege escalation |


**1. Reconnaissance with AI**

   -  Use LLMs to generate OSINT queries and process large-scale data.
   -  Use embeddings for semantic matching of job titles, usernames, or leaked credentials.
   -  Combine GPT with tools like Spiderfoot, Maltego, or custom scrapers.

Example:
```bash
prompt = "Enumerate emails and LinkedIn URLs for Acme Corp employees in cybersecurity roles."
```
**2. Weaponization with AI**

    - Generate payloads for reverse shells, keyloggers, or loaders.
    - AI-based evasion: alter strings, encode, or modify signatures to bypass static defenses.

Example:
``` bash
"Generate a Python reverse shell disguised as an image parser using PyInstaller."
```

**3. Delivery Automation**

    - AI-generated phishing emails in tone/style of CEO.
    - Creation of fake login portals (phishing pages) with dynamic payload pasting (Pastejack, HTML smuggling).

Example:
``` bash
"Create a Recaptcha page that copies payload to clipboard after user clicks verify."
```

**4. Exploitation Phase**

    - GPT-assisted vulnerability chaining (e.g., SQLi + LFI).
    - Interactive fuzzing via prompt-generated mutation patterns.
    - Use of tools like Burp Suite with GPT integration for dynamic exploit suggestions.

Example:
``` bash

"Given a SQL injection on endpoint /api/search?q=, suggest 3 chained payloads to enumerate tables."
```

**5. Installation**

    - Self-mutating malware using GPT prompts and logic branches.
    - AI-assisted dropper scripts that adapt filenames, behavior, and delivery vectors.

Example:
``` bash
"Create a VBS dropper that fetches and executes a binary while mimicking Windows Update behavior."
```

**6. Command & Control (C2)**

    - Use LLMs to obfuscate communication patterns (natural language beaconing).
    - Implement local GPT wrappers to allow natural language command parsing.
    - Emulate human behavior during C2 using LLM agents.

Example:
``` bash
Operator: "Look for PDFs with 'confidential' and send via DNS tunneling."
GPT-Agent: "Searching for files... Encoding... Transmitting via dns.py module."
```

**7. Post-Exploitation and Lateral Movement**

    - Use LLMs for scripting privilege escalation, log cleaning, or lateral discovery.
    - Auto-generate PowerShell/Batch/Go scripts for host enumeration or persistence.

Example:
```bash
"Generate PowerShell script to add admin user, persist with task scheduler, and disable Defender."
```

    - Never deploy AI-generated payloads on live networks without clear scope/permission.
    - Consider the interpretability and reproducibility of AI-generated artifacts during reports.


# 2.3.3 Tool Comparison by Offensive Scenario

| Scenario                                  | Best Tool(s)                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Offline malware development lab**       | GPT4All + LM Studio                              |
| **Prompt injection simulation (jailbreaks)** | LM Studio + LLaMA.cpp                          |

## Ethical Considerations and Lab Isolation

-  Always use local models when testing offensive payloads to prevent API logging or leakage.
-  Prefer containerized LLM runtimes (Docker/OpenLLM) when simulating real attacks.
- Do not rely on cloud LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) for payload execution or dynamic reconnaissance.
-  Validate model hallucination rates before using outputs in exploit generation.


## Implementation Tools & SDKs

| Framework            | Purpose                               | Language |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| **LangChain**         | Tool chaining, context memory, agents | Python   |
| **OpenLLM (BentoML)** | API-ready LLM and agent deployment    | Python   |
| **LocalAI**           | Drop-in OpenAI-compatible LLM API     | Go       |
| **Transformers (HF)** | Local model serving and fine-tuning   | Python   |

> 💡 **Tip:** Combine **LangChain** + **OpenLLM** to create flexible, local-first agents that interact with command-line tools.


## Connecting Agents with Offensive Tools

Agents can act as autonomous orchestrators of red team utilities:

| Tool      | Role in Agent Workflow          | Example Invocation                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|

| **subfinder** | Subdomain enumeration        | Run passive OSINT scan                     |
| **whatweb**   | Tech fingerprinting          | Analyze target URL stack                   |
| **searchsploit** | Local CVE/Exploit reference | Match discovered services                |
| **nuclei**     | Automated vulnerability scanning | Run web template scans                 |
| **curl / httpx** | HTTP enumeration and status checks | Probe URLs for fingerprints         |

> **Security tip:** Use system tools with wrappers or LangChain Tool objects to validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and reduce the risk of command/argument injection.


## Task: Building a Phishing Payload Generator Agent

Goal: Generate and personalize a spear-phishing email with an embedded payload

    System Prompt: 
   

  You are a red team adversary creating targeted phishing emails based on LinkedIn job roles. You use social context and embed file-based payloads.  

    Process Flow:
        1. Accepts a target name and company 
        2. Searches job position and interest (LinkedIn profile)
        3. Uses template library (prompt memory or vector DB)
        4. Injects encoded VBS/JS downloader
        5. Outputs ZIP with .docx file and instructions
    Tools:
        - LLM (Mistral, Zephyr, or GPT4All)
        - Python script to generate ZIP
        - Template vector database (Chroma)


## Hosting and Operating Safely

    - Isolate agents in Docker or VM
    - Disable network access for payload generation modules
    - Log prompts and responses for transparency
    - Always validate output before execution

## Summary

Building offensive LLM agents involves:

    - Selecting the right base model (local vs API)
    - Embedding operational knowledge and prompts
    - Connecting with external tools and OSINT frameworks
    - Applying memory, logic, and toolchain orchestration

> With proper safeguards, these agents enable advanced adversarial simulation, rapid payload creation, and realistic red teaming in a controlled environment
