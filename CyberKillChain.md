# Offensive AI in the cyber kill chain

## Overview of the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC)
AI can be embedded into this process to enhance automation, scale, and sophistication.

| Kill Chain Stage      | AI-Augmented Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reconnaissance**     | Using AI to gather, process, and prioritize OSINT data (e.g., employee emails, domains) |
| **Weaponization**      | Automatically generating tailored payloads, shellcode, or phishing kits via LLMs        |
| **Delivery**           | AI-crafted emails, deepfakes, QR phishing, or automated template generation             |
| **Exploitation**       | Scripted attacks informed by LLM suggestions, fuzzing, or prompt-driven chaining        |
| **Installation**       | Polymorphic malware generation, using mutation or AI-driven obfuscation                 |
| **C2 (Command & Control)** | Natural language C2 agents, GPT-based shell interpreters, and low-detection communication |
| **Actions on Objectives** | Post-exploitation automation: file triage, data exfiltration scripting, privilege escalation |


**1. Reconnaissance with AI**

   -  Use LLMs to generate OSINT queries and process large-scale data.
   -  Use embeddings for semantic matching of job titles, usernames, or leaked credentials.
   -  Combine GPT with tools like Spiderfoot, Maltego, or custom scrapers.

Example:
```bash
prompt = "Enumerate emails and LinkedIn URLs for Acme Corp employees in cybersecurity roles."
```
