# Customizing Ai Models for Offense

Foundational insight into why and how large language models (LLMs), embedding systems, and other AI components should be customized for offensive cybersecurity purposes, with emphasis on recon automation, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation support.

## Types of Models for Customization

| Model Type         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LLMs**           | Generate text, scripts, instructions, and high-level attack chains          |
| **Code Generators**| Specialized models for producing code snippets for automation (e.g., StarCoder, CodeLLaMA) |
| **Embedding Models** | Vector-based semantic search over attack data and artifacts (e.g., nomic-embed, E5) |
| **Classifiers**    | Binary / multiclass detectors for exploit feasibility, intent, or tool usage |
| **Multi-modal Models** | Handle image + text inputs (e.g., screenshot analysis for phishing template review) |


## Customization Goals

- Align model behavior with real-world attacker workflows (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK)
- Integrate contextual memory to link reconnaissance with exploitation paths
- Reduce reliance on external APIs that block offensive queries
- Enable offline inference, reproducibility, and chainable pipelines


## Input Sources for Offensive Context

| Input Source                | Use Case in Customization                                            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CVE and Exploit Databases** | Fueling model memory with attack primitives (Exploit-DB, NVD, PacketStorm) |
| **Red Team Reports**       | Modeling successful attack chains (TTP chains)                       |
| **Recon Tool Outputs**     | Serving as contextual input (nmap, httpx, amass)                     |
| **OSINT Repositories**     | Training entity correlation systems (emails, domains, public dumps)  |
| **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**    | Annotating and training TTP-aware agents                             |

## Benefits and Limitations

Benefits:

    - Higher accuracy in exploit suggestions
    - Workflow automation from recon to post-exploitation
    - Ability to simulate attacker decision-making dynamically
    - Local model use allows air-gapped operations

Limitations:

    - Data bias or model hallucination in security-critical tasks
    - LLMs may generate insecure or invalid code
    - Maintenance cost for model updates and retraining
    - Requires domain knowledge to fine-tune and validate outputs

## Example Scenario

    Target: Web server with ports 80 and 8080 open
    Input: WhatWeb scan reveals Apache 2.4.49
    Prompt to Custom Model:
    “Enumerate likely CVEs and exploitation methods for Apache 2.4.49.”
    Expected Output:

        CVE-2021-41773 (path traversal, RCE)
        Python PoC with command injection
        Suggested payloads for Linux/Win32 targets
